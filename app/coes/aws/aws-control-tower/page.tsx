           AWS has undeniably transformed resource utilization management with its self-service approach. However, it also introduces significant challenges such as increased costs due to underutilized or unnecessary resources, security risks posed by unused or unmonitored resources, and complexity in managing many resources while ensuring compliance with policies and best practices. This puts organizations in a difficult position to balance best practices with effective cloud budget management.</p>
